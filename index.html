<p class="info" id="info" > I am a boy from solapur which is in Maharashtra. From my childhoom we had a pentium cpu pc,
    and then after few years we had a new laptop and after 5yrs it was not in use for 6 months then
I took it as my personal laptop and allowed every one to use and I liked using pc and learning various thing in it
and one day I got a call from Edurific Coding course and I joined it because I wanted to learn coading and my teacher was
also a naruto fan so always while teaching I was never confused because sir also knewed that I was a naruto fan too so 
in some hard situation he teached me in naruto language so I was always able to do it properly and now my basic course in done so 
this is my demo where I am testing my coding skills. </p>
